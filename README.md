This project explores sleep health in humans by taking into account the various factors that may affect sleep quality, including health metrics, lifestyle, gender, and age. The project utilizes machine learning methods, specifically linear regression modeling, to help determine what plays an important role in quality of sleep. 

The final report for this project was created using LaTex in overleaf. At this time, it is a work in progress.
